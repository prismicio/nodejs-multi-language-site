## Deploy your Node.js Multi-language project
 
An easy way to deploy your Node.js website is to use [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). Just follow these few simple steps once you have successfully [signed up](https://id.heroku.com/signup/www-header) and [installed the Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/):
 
Create a new Heroku application
 
```
heroku create
```
 
Initialize a new Git repository:
 
```
git init
heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app-name
```
 
Commit your code to the Git repository and deploy it to Heroku:
 
```
git add .
git commit -am "make it better"
git push heroku master
```
Ensure you have at least one node running:
 
```
heroku ps:scale web=1
```
 
You can now browse your application online:
 
```
heroku open
```
